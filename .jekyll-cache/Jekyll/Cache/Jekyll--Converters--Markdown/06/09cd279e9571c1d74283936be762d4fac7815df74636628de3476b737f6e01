I"~<p>In September 2014 I embarked upon a vaguely epic quest to <a href="http://peterussell.me/running/2014/09/11/and-i-will-run-700-miles.html">try running 700
miles in a year</a>. Although it’s taken me a few months for the follow
up, I’m delighted to report that in one year (+/- 1 week) I hit the 700 miles.</p>

<p>I’ve continued tracking my little excursions because it’s
been fun to see the variety of distances and frequency month to month. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w6y5S43TY2k0FYGtOxLKdMu1ApPNurtuu8IRtRcsqI4/edit?usp=sharing">The
spreadsheet’s here</a>. Current status: 846.63 miles (1362.51891 km),
most of the way San Francisco to Denver - or Wellington to Auckland a couple of
times, plus a bit</p>

<p>So, lessons learned?</p>

<ul>
  <li>variety = fun. Something like (per week): 1x distance, 1x short, 1x 3 miles for time, 1x intervals</li>
  <li>it’s a fantastic way to check out new places, especially on longer runs</li>
  <li>it makes damn near no difference to weight without consideration for food</li>
  <li>it’s ideal travel exercise, running shoes are way easier to fit on a plane than a bike</li>
  <li>don’t make huge distance increases, even if you’re feeling really good. The feeling of ‘man, I could have run so much further’ is a good fodder for wanting to go on the next run</li>
  <li>longer runs were often the hardest to get motived for, but they were my favourites when I was actually doing them. They’re almost always the ones I remember most</li>
  <li>being lighter generally made runs easier, I’d usually have half a cup of coffee and something small to eat before running. I did a few runs after a beer or two – wouldn’t recommend it</li>
  <li>the first few minutes is often the hardest while you loosen up, if it feels crap at the start there’s a good chance it’ll get better (most of the time, at least…)</li>
</ul>
