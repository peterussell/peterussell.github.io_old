<p>I was incredibly lucky to fly in the back of Oliverâ€™s beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_195">Cessna 195</a> from San Carlos to Sacramento, then found myself unexpectedly in a rare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stearman_Aircraft">Boeing Stearman</a> for the return trip.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an <a href="http://skyvector.com/?ll=38.0348960835195,-121.38601684210076&amp;chart=301&amp;zoom=5&amp;plan=A.K2.KSQL:A.K2.KHWD:A.K2.KSAC">approximate map of the route</a> on SkyVector.com.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been a member of the EAA for a short while now and itâ€™s something Iâ€™d recommend to anyone interested in aviation. Despite the â€˜Experimentalâ€™ in the name, the EAA isnâ€™t exclusively a range of mad scientists experimenting with crazy aircraft designs (although I wonâ€™t go as far as to say it precludes it either).</p>

<p>They support a wide range of interests, from homebuilt airplanes, warbirds, to sport aircraft (aerobatics, racing) and a lot more. The people are exceptionally friendly and some of the most knowledgeable pilots and aviation enthusiasts Iâ€™ve met. They also run generous programs, like volunteering to provide free flights to kids between 8 and 17 via <a href="http://www.eaa.org/en/eaa/aviation-education-and-resources/eaa-youth-education/eaa-young-eagles-program">Young Eagles</a>.</p>
