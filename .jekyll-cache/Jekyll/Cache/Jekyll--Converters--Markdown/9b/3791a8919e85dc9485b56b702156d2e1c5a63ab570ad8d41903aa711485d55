I"<p>First, I apologise for the hiatus. But weâ€™re here now and thatâ€™s what
matters.</p>

<p>Later this year, Eve and I have decided to sell our artisanal Ikea collection
and head south west, for New Zealand. After much deliberation - and only
changing our minds once - weâ€™ve settled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch">Christchurch</a> in the South Island.</p>

<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Itâ€™s something new, for both of us (I grew up in Wellington).</li>
  <li>The â€˜internationalâ€™ airport makes it an easy single hop from
Auckland or Wellington. Especially important for international
visitors, and visiting my family.</li>
  <li>Job marketâ€™s reasonable.</li>
  <li>A comprehensive flying school/club.</li>
  <li>Top notch access to South Island hiking, (I donâ€™t think I can bring myself
to say â€˜trampingâ€™ any more), climbing, mountain biking, â€¦</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision to move wasnâ€™t frivolous. Itâ€™s certainly an exciting time, but
also bittersweet. The US, for all its questionable antics, has stolen a bit of my
heart some time during the last (nearly) six years. Itâ€™s a country with
opportunities, experiences, friendships, and BBQ that I never expected to
be privy to, and will always be grateful for.</p>
