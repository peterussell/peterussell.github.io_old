I"><p>In September 2014 I embarked upon a vaguely epic quest to <a href="http://peterussell.me/running/2014/09/11/and-i-will-run-700-miles.html">try running 700
miles in a year</a>. Although it’s taken me a few months for the follow
up, I’m delighted to report that in one year (+/- 1 week) I hit the 700 miles.</p>
