I"®<p>Over the last year or so Iâ€™ve been working on a Winforms app to pull images from a piece
of medical imaging hardware and print them to a network printer. At the genesis of the project
I was doing a lot of C#.Net development which made it a great choice of platform (back then
at least), but Iâ€™ve since spent more and more of my so-called â€˜professionalâ€™ life knee-deep in
other languages and I feel a bit â€¦ rusty.</p>
