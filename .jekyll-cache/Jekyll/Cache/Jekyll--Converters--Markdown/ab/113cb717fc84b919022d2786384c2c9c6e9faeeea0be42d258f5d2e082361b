I"Þ<p>Iâ€™ve been mulling over how last year played out with regard to the
(perhaps lofty) <a href="/programming/2015/08/25/life-before-30.html">goals Iâ€™d set for myself</a>, and a recurring theme became - man, that was
a lot of stuff to keep tabs on.</p>

<p>This yearâ€™s simpler: something professional, something exercise-y, and something else (credit to someone from
Reddit for the concept). Iâ€™ll give a quick outline here and elaborate on each in a future post.</p>

<h1 id="professional-wxdecodercom">Professional: WXDecoder.com</h1>

<p>I noticed about last year was that there wasnâ€™t a huge amount of momentum on any single
project (Image Workstation being the exception), which Iâ€™ll try blaming on the
fractured division of time between projects.</p>

<p>This year Iâ€™ll commit to working on just one project and see how far it goes.</p>

<h1 id="exercise-y-climbing">Exercise-y: Climbing</h1>

<p>This one has two parts: get better, and get outside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Climb 3 V8s indoors</li>
  <li>Climb 3 V6s outdoors</li>
</ul>

<p>Added incentive: a buddy and I are planning to do a climbing road-trip next year. Between that and a
healthy dose of bad nineties climbing videos, we have motivation in droves.</p>

<h1 id="something-else-flying">Something else: Flying</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Pass the Instrument Rating checkride</li>
  <li>Get a Complex endorsement (wheels go up-and-down)</li>
  <li>Log 30 hours tailwheel time</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m considering a Commercial Pilot certificate (CPL), but some complexities exist about whether
this makes any sense. Will revisit it later.</p>

<h1 id="other">Other</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The reading challenge last year was well worth it, so that stays. 18 books this year.</li>
</ul>

<p>More soon.</p>
