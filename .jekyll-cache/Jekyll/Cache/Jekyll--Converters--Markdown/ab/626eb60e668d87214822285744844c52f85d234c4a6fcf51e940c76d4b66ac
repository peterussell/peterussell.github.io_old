<p>Itâ€™s been a week of treadmills. I get the feeling a lot of runners arenâ€™t
very fond of them, but I find their consistency makes it easier to track
progress. I also kinda think itâ€™s fun to put together little routines with
changes in pace and incline, and attemping to convince my legs to keep
up with the belt.</p>

<p>That said, I also still really enjoy getting out on the real pavement,
but I treat those as more of a zen experience - no phones, watches, music
etc. It provides a nice contrast to the more intense treadmill sessions.</p>

<p>Last week the end of a short recovery after developing a kickass blister
after an hour run - at least I got almost 7.5 miles out of it. These shoes
have caused that problem occassionally in the past but this is definitely the 
worst theyâ€™ve been. Fortunately after a couple of 3-day breaks it looks like
things are back up and -ahem- running.</p>

<p>Despite the delay Iâ€™ve logged 36.22 miles for just over half of September,
including a rather hungover 3 miles at 8am at a Reno hotel after a day of
decadence at the Reno Air Races (fried zucchini and bratwurst anyone?) Things
are looking good to hit the monthâ€™s 58.3 mile target, and at this pace
should make up for Augustâ€™s deficit due to missing the first week.</p>

<p>Things are feeling good and the regular runs are starting to get easier, the
idea of running three 5-mile days back to back definitely doesnâ€™t seem as
daunting as it did a couple of months ago, so something must be going right.</p>
