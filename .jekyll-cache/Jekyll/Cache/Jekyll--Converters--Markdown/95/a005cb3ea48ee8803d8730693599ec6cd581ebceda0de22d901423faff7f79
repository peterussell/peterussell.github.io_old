I"ÿ<p>After a hiatus due to a snapped rear axle (guy opens car door in bike lane &gt; swerve &gt;
train track &gt; over the handlebars &amp; a broken bike) all the pieces are back together.
We ride again!</p>

<p>Bent brake arms still require fixing. They make about 50% contact with the rim, but
theyâ€™re alright for now as long as it doesnâ€™t rain (lucky about that drought, huh?)</p>
