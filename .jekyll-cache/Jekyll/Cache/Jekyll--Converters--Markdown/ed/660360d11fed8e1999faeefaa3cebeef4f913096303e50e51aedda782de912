<p><strong>Flying</strong></p>

<p>The spirit of Jimmy Doolittle has smiled upon me and Iâ€™m happy to
report the instrument rating checkride was a success. The ride was
a 3 hour oral, and 2.2 hour flight test, split over two days
due to a failed turn coordinator. It was a fun, though fairly
intense checkride, but Iâ€™m very happy to have done the rating.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve decided to go for the commercial multi-engine rating, and set up
<a href="http://cpl.peterussell.me">cpl.peterussell.me</a> for study notes and flight debriefs. Looking
back on instrument training I wish Iâ€™d been more rigorous about
documenting flight debriefs, so nowâ€™s my chance to make good.</p>

<p>The tailwheel time has been slowly building. Weâ€™ve had pretty rubbish
weather lately, but Iâ€™ve managed to squeeze in flights on most sunny
days. The logbook says 9.7 hours and Iâ€™m starting to feel comfortable
in the SportCub, itâ€™s definitely some of the most fun flying Iâ€™ve done.</p>

<p><strong>WX Decoder</strong></p>

<p>The first version of the REST API is now live. It supports
decoding METARs (avation weather reports) for two basic use cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As a user, I want to specify an airport ID. The website should fetch the
latest METAR, decode it, and return it to me.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Example for Portland International (KDPX):</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="http://api.wxdecoder.com/metar/decode/kpdx">api.wxdecoder.com/metar/decode/kpdx</a></p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As a user, I have METAR text which I want to decode. I want some way
to submit raw METAR text to the website, then the website should decode
the text into a friendly format and return that decoded text to me.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This one requires including the raw METAR string in the body of a GET
request toâ€¦</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="http://api.wxdecoder.com/metar/decode">api.wxdecoder.com/metar/decode</a></p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The REST API is written with the Django REST Framework (DRF), deployed on
Heroku. Feel free to play around with it, and if you see any issues or
have suggestions you can get me <a href="https://twitter.com/nz_pete">@nz_pete</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Climbing</strong></p>

<p>A bit more training and a bit less drinking beer (boo) is paying off, I
climbed my first <em>ever</em> V7 indoors last week. Iâ€™ve been working a
second which should go in the next session or two. Progress.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also been asking around about outdoor spots, and signed up to the
<a href="http://www.carverclimbingclub.org">Carver Climbing Club</a> - apparently is an excellent spot close
to Portland. Now to wait for the weather gods and spend some more time
climbing plastic. Really looking forward to getting outside.</p>
