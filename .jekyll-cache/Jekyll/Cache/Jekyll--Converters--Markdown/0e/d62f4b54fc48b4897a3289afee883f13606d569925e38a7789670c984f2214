I"Á<p>I live in a small one-bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and her (ahem, â€˜ourâ€™) dog, which is also where I currently spend the majority of my working life. Every now and then itâ€™s nice to get a change of scenery and Iâ€™ve discovered that the cafe at Wholefoods is one of the better spots.</p>

<h1 id="pros">Pros</h1>

<ul>
  <li>reasonably fast free wifi, allows VPN access</li>
  <li>always seems to be space to get a reasonably secluded spot</li>
  <li>good food, good coffee, good beer (for when things have really gone pear-shaped)</li>
  <li>parking garage (SF parking is turrble and/or expensive)</li>
  <li>ample power outlets</li>
  <li>choices of wooden seats or couches</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="cons">Cons</h1>

<ul>
  <li>wifi times out after 20 mins (although there may be ways around thatâ€¦)</li>
  <li>working on a wooden seat for hours isnâ€™t ideal</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these are common between Wholefoods and other cafes, but having looked around for places for a while now I find that good reliable internet, and the quality and variety of food (thereâ€™s a proper kitchen, or a by-the-pound hot and cold buffet in the supermarket proper) isnâ€™t always so easy to come by.</p>

<p>The apartment weâ€™ve moving to in Portland has a second bedroom, itâ€™ll be nice
to have a more dedicated office space and not be living the majority of my life within about 100 square feet. Still, itâ€™s fun to get out try some different work environments.</p>
