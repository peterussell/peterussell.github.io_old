I"∑<p>I‚Äôm jumping on the bandwagon, if only to see what the fuss is about, and will
attempt to make an iPhone application this month. I‚Äôm excited to try out a new
language and developing for a new form factor, having never programmed anything
for mobile before.</p>

<p>The goal is to write a basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist">checklist</a> app for the Cessna 172SP,
which should be a manageable task but allow room to add fancy features later
on. A number of good checklist apps already exist so this is just ‚Äòfor teh lolz‚Äô,
as it were.</p>

<p>Before all that hooplah, it‚Äôs time for the quintessential Hello World app. I‚Äôm
following the bite-size tutorials at <a href="http://codewithchris.com/1-introduction-to-the-tools-and-materials/">codewithchris.com</a> and now I have this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2015-01-07/hello-world.png" alt="Hello World" /></p>

<p>I‚Äôm using Swift (I hear it‚Äôs all the rage) and Xcode 6.1.1. Topics covered so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>iOS MVC overview</li>
  <li>creating a new project</li>
  <li>navigating the Xcode workspace</li>
  <li>adding a Label object to the storyboard, changing text</li>
  <li>running the iOS simulator, changing device type, and screen orientation (‚åò ‚Üê, ‚åò ‚Üí)</li>
  <li>autolayout, using alignment constraints to center text vertically/horizontally</li>
</ul>

<p>They say the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single iPhone app. So, onward!</p>
