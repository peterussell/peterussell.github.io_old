I"0<p>I live in a small one-bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and her (ahem, ‘our’) dog, which is also where I currently spend the majority of my working life. Every now and then it’s nice to get a change of scenery and I’ve discovered that the cafe at Wholefoods is one of the better spots.</p>
