I"—<p>Number Four: Health (and fitness).</p>

<h3 id="climb-v7-indoors">Climb V7 Indoors</h3>

<p>I started climbing at the ripe old age 12 at HangDog in Lower Hutt, and to this day itâ€™s still my main form of exercise. Sure, Iâ€™ve been running a bit lately, but I run to help my climbing, not climb to help my running.</p>

<p>At the moment Iâ€™m almost exclusively bouldering, mainly because I never got around to taking the belay test. My
ability has a tendency to go in swings and roundabouts, often due to being sore, bored, or just having other
things going on. Enough is enough. The idea is that setting a goal will prevent the
sort of aimless meandering format my climbing currently (or did, back in August) adheres to.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve climbed V7 before, but Iâ€™m currently back down to around V5. I intend to get back to
a level where I can happily call myself a V7 (indoor, San Francisco level) climber.</p>

<p>I also want to climb a lot more outside, but I havenâ€™t set any specific metrics for what that constitutes.
I <em>am</em> really excited about joining <a href="http://thecircuitgym.com/gallery/">The Circuit Bouldering Gym</a> when we move to Portland (oh, Iâ€™m moving to Portland in January. More later).</p>

<p>Nailing this V7 stuff isnâ€™t rocket science. I just need to work on  getting stronger (campus board, weight training) and lighter, which brings me toâ€¦</p>

<h3 id="get-back-under-85kg">Get (back) under 85kg</h3>

<p>I hit a weight peak during university (pro tip, not owning scales doesnâ€™t help with keeping track
of weight). Pizza and shitty-energy-drink-fuelled all-nighters are a really fun way to get a computer science
degree, but didnâ€™t help much with my ability to outrun an attacking bear or execute a perfect pirouette, for
example. Ironically, after moving to the US (land of large, loud peopleâ€¦ right? Well, perhaps in some places, but not in San Francisco) I got into the best shape I think Iâ€™ve been in, down around 83kg.</p>

<p>Weightâ€™s not something Iâ€™m particularly obsessed with. But thereâ€™s the climbing thing, and the lighter I am the
more I can fit in an airplane. And a â€˜weight goalâ€™ is pretty much a requirement for any list like this. Who am
I to break with years of tradition.</p>

<p>Currently Iâ€™m sitting around 88kg. When I started this list in August I was just shy of 92kg (due to late evenings coding and beer), meaning the current trajectory indicates good things.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been tracking calories with MyFitnessPal, marvellous, trying to stick with 1,800 calories/day for 6 days a week. The fitness schedule is climbing, running, and biking schedule which has me doing something most days. Thereâ€™s a gym near our new apartment with a swimming pool, which Iâ€™m keen to get back into.</p>

<p>Just to throw a spanner in the works, thereâ€™s an upcoming trip to New Zealand and I havenâ€™t had a meat pie in a
long time. Weâ€™ll have to see how that one plays out.</p>
