I"<p>Well, goodness, 30â€™s really happened.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not all that bad. My limbs still mostly work, not too many new
bodily noises, weâ€™re enjoying life in a different little bit of the world
(pretty close to the last one, but I like it a lot more), and I seem to have
acquired part ownership of a dog. So far so good.</p>

<p>Admittedly Iâ€™ve done a  poor job of tracking progress, but Iâ€™m here to make amends.
That said, just having this list in the back of my mind during the year has been helpful
as a subconscious aid in guiding decisions about how to spend time and resources, so itâ€™s
been a worthwhile exercise in that regard.</p>

<p>So now down to business, time for some tough love.</p>

<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>

<p><strong>Complete development on the Image Workstation app</strong> (good)</p>

<ul>
  <li>We did get a working version of the app, including a proper installer
and licensing, running in a hospital - but havenâ€™t taken it much further than
that. Lessons: next time Iâ€™ll spend more time getting CI, test coverage, and
nightly builds sorted out (especially for catching regressions). Building something
from start to finish was as a really wortwhile project though - and surprisingly
different to coming in to an existing project or using an existing framework. I
learned a bundle and really enjoyed working on it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Release a first version of Peggy</strong> (bad)</p>

<ul>
  <li>This fell by the wayside. Iâ€™d still like to do this, especially from
the angle of getting back some C/C++ skills - unfortunately it just wasnâ€™t
really a priority this year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Develop some kind of web-based/JavaScript thing</strong> (ok)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™ve registered <a href="http://www.wxdecoder.com">wxdecoder.com</a> for this purpose. During the year
I did experiment with some modern web frameworks, namely React+Redux, but only
recently found a project interesting enough to justify putting significant time
into. This oneâ€™s making the list for the coming year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fortnightly Posts</strong> (bad)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, that could certainly have gone better. Lessons: probably requires an actual
schedule, eg. every Sunday night, rather than a kind of hand-wavy promise of
â€˜yeah, probably, like, every couple of weeks or something.â€™ Good learning experience,
I <em>will</em> get better. Although I did post 70+ entries on my <a href="http://ir.peterussell.me">instrument training
website</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flying">Flying</h3>

<p>This was probably where most of the effort went this year, resulting in the
sidelining of a few other goals.</p>

<p><strong>Instrument Rating</strong> (good (nearly))</p>

<ul>
  <li>Didnâ€™t quite squeeze it in before 30, but itâ€™s pretty damn close. Partly it
was because of the decision to move, so I delayed beginning training until
we were settled in our new spot. Current status: Iâ€™ve completed the practical
syllabus, passed the written (92%!), and just 3.4 more simulated/actual instrument
hours to take the checkride. Plan is mid-September.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Take an intro aerobatic flight</strong> (bad)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Didnâ€™t really count on there being very little aerobatic flight training
available near Portland.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(bonus) CPL</strong> (ok)</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPL training will begin shortly after finishing IR (finances pending), although
it looks like Iâ€™ve already met most of the hourly requirements already
(hence the â€˜okâ€™ rating).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(bonus) Tailwheel Endorsement</strong> (good)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tailwheel endorsed! 4.8 hours for the endorsement. Iâ€™ve only flown a couple
of times since the endorsement due to IR training taking priority, but itâ€™s
totally my kind of flying and I intend to do much more of it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(bonus) Aerobatic Checkout</strong> (ok)</p>

<ul>
  <li>No aerobatic, but Iâ€™m checked out to solo in the clubâ€™s SportCub S2
tail wheel, so Iâ€™m going to sneak that in here as a pass for this one.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<p><strong>Become reasonably fluent in a second language</strong> (bad/ok)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can I fluently speak a second language? Absolutely not. But I have learned a
collection of relatively unrelated phrases in French. Still want to do this so
itâ€™s back on the list. Iâ€™ve been using the Duolingo app and it seems to be
great - just requires a bit more consistency on my part.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Read 16 books (bonus: 20)</strong> (good)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Brave New World, The Right Stuff, Catch-22, Elon Muskâ€™s Biography, So Good They Canâ€™t Ignore You, Bill Gatesâ€™ Biography, Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Fighter Pilot (Robin Olds Biography), Network Geeks: How They Built The Internet, Alaskaâ€™s Sky Follies, Syd Barrettâ€™s Biography, Flight of Passage, The Starship Diaries, Capt. Jepp and the Little Black Book (Elrey Jeppesenâ€™s Biography), The Cathedral and the Bazaar, Into the Wild.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="health">Health</h3>

<p><strong>Climb V7 indoors</strong> (ok)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™m calling this in and saying itâ€™s only partially my fault. I managed three V6s
this year and Iâ€™m confident that V7 was on the cards until a couple of consecutive
(popped knee, then a torn calf) laid those plans to rest. Iâ€™m back on the proverbial
horse, started training again, and will have some lofty goals in the coming year for sure.
Mainly to get outside and make the most of Oregon climbing. The gyms are great - but
Iâ€™m really missing the outside time.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(bonus) Climb V8 indoors</strong> (bad)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Negative, Ghostrider.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Weight (back) under 85kg</strong> (bad)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nup. Iâ€™ve essentially stayed about the same weight. Iâ€™m sure there are lots of
excuses I could think up (moving, injuries, etc.) but really itâ€™s on me. It certainly
wasnâ€™t for lack of exercise, but I also donâ€™t think moving to one of the best
beer cities in the world has helped very much. Going to take this a bit more
seriously this year.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finances">Finances</h3>

<p><strong>Student Loan under $10k</strong> (ok)</p>

<ul>
  <li>This was probably ambitious. Iâ€™ve made good progress
(and paid off well over the required amount for overseas borrowers), but
have shifted priorities a bit (retirement savings, getting flight training
done, etc.) so Iâ€™m still a bit shy. Should be an easy one to tackle this year.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>So it appears to be a mixed bag of results, but overall Iâ€™m really happy with
how the yearâ€™s worked out. A lotâ€™s happened and big plans are in their genesis.</p>

<p>Next week Iâ€™ll post goals for my inaugral year as a
30-something, along with a plan to be more rigorous about checking in and
tracking progress. I welcome being over the hill with open arms and only a
slight shortness of breath. Time to go buy a Harley.</p>
