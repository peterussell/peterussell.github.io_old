I"Š<p>The <a href="http://peterussell.me/programming/2015/11/04/Image-Workstation-Update.html">Image Workstation</a> app Iâ€™ve been working on is now installed our awesome test
hospital and from what Iâ€™ve heard things seem to be going well. Aside from just being good
news, it also means <a href="http://peterussell.me/programming/2015/09/14/Life-Before-30-Technology.html">one more thing ticked off the list</a>.</p>

<p>All of a sudden I have a bit more time to work on the little text adventure game I started
on a few years ago (and, also, ahem, never finished). My goal is to get a really, <em>really</em>
minimal prototype working, which entails:</p>

<ul>
  <li>starting the game</li>
  <li>navigating a map of 4 rooms</li>
  <li>collecting 2 items</li>
  <li>getting to the â€˜finalâ€™ room which completes the game, if you have the 2 items</li>
</ul>

<p>The tiny scope of this first implementation is intentional, with the idea that it should make
it small enough to get finished quickly. After that I can add more bits and pieces but
there should (almost) always be a working platform to build off.</p>

<p>A good chunk of the game engine (in C++) already exists from earlier days, although Iâ€™ve
probably forgotten a lot of C++ since then. For now Iâ€™m concentrating on getting a web
UI working using React with Redux.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be the first to admit I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing, but Iâ€™ve put the source on <a href="https://github.com/peterussell/peggy2">Github</a>
anyway in case anyone wants to have a nosey. If you want to download and run it, something
like this should work:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/peterussell/peggy2
cd peggy2
npm install
npm run example server.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then hit http://localhost:5050.</p>
