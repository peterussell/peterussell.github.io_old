I"Ê<p>Hello from New Zealand!</p>

<p>I made use of some airport downtime to tidy up the
UI a little bit. Itâ€™s still a long way from its final
incarnation, but at least represents the idea of entering a command,
then having the command and response displayed and scroll upwards
from above the input window.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2016-01-11/peggy-updated-ui.png" width="400" /></p>

<p>The next two tasks, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hook up the web UI to the C++ game server</li>
  <li>set up a public web server (probably a quick â€˜n dirty job) so anyone can try out the game</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, <a href="https://github.com/peterussell/peggy2">source is available on github</a>.</p>
