I"ê<p>I noticed the instrument training ground school/sim/flying posts were cluttering up the place, so Iâ€™ve moved them to a separate site specifically for the purpose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h1 id="httpirpeterussellme"><a href="http://ir.peterussell.me">http://ir.peterussell.me</a></h1>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ll continue posting major updates - the cross country flights, photos, milestones - on this website, but all the nitty-gritty will henceforth reside in those greener pastures.</p>
