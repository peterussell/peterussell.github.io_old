I"4<p>Recently, admist a flurry of fly-in camping (a first), day baseball (also a first), and general decadence, I encountered my 29th birthday. So, before this whole life thing gets carried away and I’m a <em>30 year old</em> I’d like to try and get some things done. Time to don my list making pants.</p>
