<p>With an ominous 28th birthday approaching, an idea presented itself that
I should try to achieve a Big Thing before the 29th, and so began the
journey to run 700 miles (about 1,126 km) in a year.</p>

<p>So why 700 miles?</p>

<p>Well, itâ€™s a distance reasonable enough that it doesnâ€™t completely
ruin day-to-day life, making me become that â€œ.. sorry I canâ€™t, I have to go
for a runâ€ guy. At the same time something far enough that itâ€™s not 
trivial to achieve.</p>

<p>Breaking it down the goal is to run at least 58.3 miles per month,
or just over 13 miles per week. That doesnâ€™t seem so bad any more. Right?</p>

<p>But the key, for me, is consistency. On occassion Iâ€™ve been known to go for longer
runs of 10+ miles every now and then, but theyâ€™d ruin me for a couple of days
and thatâ€™d be it for the week. One of the aims of this little adventure is to run shorter
distances more consistently. Ideally Iâ€™d like to end up running almost every day
for at least a couple of miles.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m using a simple <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w6y5S43TY2k0FYGtOxLKdMu1ApPNurtuu8IRtRcsqI4/edit?usp=sharing">Google spreadsheet</a> to track my progress. Not too
pretty, but it works for now and quick to use. Iâ€™m mixing it up betweene outdoor
runs (O) and treadmills (TM) due to some sketchy knees - running every day out
on the asphalt makes for a bad time. I also plan to post regular updates here about
hopes, dreams, feelings, world domination, bowel movemâ€¦ never mind.</p>
