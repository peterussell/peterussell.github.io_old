<h3 id="become-reasonably-fluent-in-a-second-language">Become Reasonably Fluent in a Second Language</h3>

<p>This one’s been on the list for a long time - I’m sure I’m not alone in that sentiment. French is my language of choice because it’s spoken in places I’m keen to spend at least a little more time in the future  (including Tahiti in January.. muaha etc.).</p>

<p>I’ve been using the free iPad app from <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">www.duolingo.com</a>, usually doing a couple of lessons most nights before bed. The lessons only take about 5-10 minutes each which make them nice bite-size chunks.</p>

<p>As of today I could to ask for a red cat, or inform my fellow baguette-lovers that the man is eating an apple. Progress.</p>

<h3 id="read-16-books">Read 16 Books</h3>

<p>I’ve noticed a common trait shared by most people I admire is a penchant for reading - there must be something to it. Instead of pursuing any in-depth analysis (in large part due to laziness) I figured I’d just start reading more and see how it works out. And I like reading. It’s sexy.</p>

<p>It also seems like a good excuse to spend less quality time with the TV (although I don’t watch a whole heap anyway and tend to glaze over when Game of Thrones talk begins). Now there’s a good excuse: ‘Sorry, got 16 books that need reading’.</p>

<p>I don’t have a reading list per se, but imagine it’ll be a mix of fiction and non-fiction. So far I’ve finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076DDBJ6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">So Good They Can’t Ignore You</a> by Cal Newport, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forever-Flying-High-flying-Barnstorming-Autobiography/dp/067153761X">Forever Flying</a>, a biography about the legendary pilot Bob Hoover (my really-cool mum got me a signed copy). I’m currently involved with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048WQDIE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Catch-22</a> by Joseph Heller, which I’ve wanted to read for ages. See, the plan works!</p>

<p>After that I’m going to re-read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Benjamin-Franklin-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486290735">Autobiograpy of Benjamin Franklin</a>, and then (or more likely at the same time) Rod Machado’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rod-Machados-Instrument-Pilots-Handbook/dp/0971201560">Instrument Pilot’s Handbook</a> to prep for the Instrument Pilot written exam. Annnnnd then, well, I’m open to suggestions.</p>
