I"Ù<p>I recorded a short flight over the San Francisco bay. I hadnâ€™t flown into Livermore
Airport as a solo pilot before so I decided to do a triangle route, including Palo
Alto, and then finish back at San Carlos.</p>

<p>The video includes some ATC and recorded using a Garmin Virb (not bad for
a $99 Groupon).</p>

<p>I plan to record more flying videos in the future and upload them under the moniker
â€˜FlyingKiwiâ€™, feel free to subscribe to the YouTube channel if youâ€™re interested in
seeing more. This marks my first attempt at editing and uploading a video, so suggestions
are welcome. Enjoy!</p>
