I"¦<p>In May 2013 I started flight training from San Carlos (KSQL) in the Bay Area. It all came about
after â€˜Take a discovery flightâ€™ ended up on a list very similar list to this one.</p>

<p>Earlier this year two friends and I flew a Cessna 182 across North America to <a href="http://www.eaa.org/en/airventure">Oshkosh Airventure</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmkcPN3fp9E&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m47s">ended up on the tellie</a>. Itâ€™s safe to say things have escalated since that fateful
day in 2013.</p>

<p>Flyingâ€™s a big part of my life now. I passed my Private Pilot Certificate (PPL) in 2014, have about 180 hours.
Iâ€™m checked out on a few different airplanes (Cessna 162, 172, 172SP, 182, and G1000 cockpits), and have a high
performance endorsement.</p>

<p>Instrument Rating, or IR, is the next step for me.</p>

<p>An IR certifies you to fly an airplane with only reference to instrumentation in
the cockpit, ie. without looking out the window (seriously, they make you wear <a href="http://www.pilottodd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-17-at-9.03.48-AM.png">these things</a>).
This certification allows you to - among other things - fly in and through clouds, which I currently canâ€™t
as a lowly Private Pilot, and it adds a big chunk of skills to your flying back of tricks.</p>

<p>After that, Iâ€™d like to continue to get my Commercial certificate (CPL), which involves a lot more book
knowledge, and finer tuning of manuevers learned in the private pilot syllabus as well as a bundle of
new maneuvers. Overall the CPL training tends to result in better, or at least more experienced, pilots.
In the interest of self-preservation Iâ€™d like to be one of those.</p>

<p>Then thereâ€™s aerobatics, which Iâ€™ve become very, very interested in after attending a lot of seminars at
Airventure, and watching <a href="https://youtu.be/uRz6JpPrESE?t=22s">this video</a> on repeat (if you watch nothing else, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/uRz6JpPrESE?t=40s">this
unreasonable takeoff</a> and possibly <a href="https://youtu.be/uRz6JpPrESE?t=10m53s">the most insane landing youâ€™ll ever see</a>).
The skills that even amateur aerobatic pilots possess seem to be very handy things to have, and itâ€™s all
about being a better and safer aviator (not to mention really â€˜earningâ€™ the giant watch and aviator sunglasses).</p>

<p>Aerobatics is unfamiliar territory, particularly being unfamiliar with how much of
my stomach content will end up in the airplane. The main idea is to take an intro flight and see how
that goes. If itâ€™s a success (and I really want it to be a success) Iâ€™d like to learn a few basic
maneuvers - and who knows what might happen after that ;)</p>

<p>Finally, the tailwheel comes about because a good number of the aerobatic airplanes Iâ€™d like to fly
are tailwheel (tailwheel means the third, smaller, wheel is at the back instead of the front).
Thereâ€™s a crazy idea I have one day of getting checked out in a warbird (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_T-6_Texan">T6 Texan</a>)
which are almost exclusively tailwheel aircraft, so that seems like a good place to start.</p>

<p>Now, just to pay for it all.</p>
