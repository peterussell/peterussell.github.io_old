I"|<p>Recent conversations got me thinking about reviving an online
spot to keep track of all that’s going on. Ladies and
gents: here it is.</p>

<p>The old Drupal site died a slow and very dull death. It was <em>mostly</em>
OK, but when it came to some tasks the struggle was real
(inserting an image was like an 8-step process). It was also slow
as balls.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sharpoblunto.com/News">Glenn</a> told me about Jekyll, which uses markdown
(used by <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>) with some other bits, then spits out static
HTML files.</p>

<p>It gives enough flexibility to be useful without being
a maintenance nightmare (we’ll ignore the fact that I don’t really
know how to write markdown). It should also be super fast and - possibly
best of all - means Vim for editing instead of those mediocre-at-best
WYSIWYGs.</p>

<p>In the interest of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=JFDI">JFDI</a> we’re kicking things off with basically
all the defaults in place. Rough edges will be smoothed as time permits.
Just think of it as some crazy amateur-blog adventure.</p>

<p>Or, something.</p>
