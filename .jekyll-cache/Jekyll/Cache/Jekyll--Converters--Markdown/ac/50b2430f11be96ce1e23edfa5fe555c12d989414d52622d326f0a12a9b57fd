<p>Set up a simple React website using SASS/SCSS and Bootstrap.</p>

<h1 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h1>

<p>An existing React web application (see the docs on
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">How to create a react app</a>  if you need help), and 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> installed.</p>

<h1 id="1-install-node-sass">1. Install node-sass</h1>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install --save node-sass</code></p>

<p>The node-sass module adds the SASS preprocessor to your React project,
allowing you to write SASS/SCSS (which browsers donâ€™t understand) and
have it come out as CSS (which browser do understand).</p>

<h1 id="2-use-scss-files-in-components">2. Use SCSS files in components</h1>

<p>Itâ€™s generally recommended to keep React components completely
self-contained. One way to follow this paradigm is to give each
component its own stylesheet. For example, this is how Iâ€™ve added
a <code class="highlighter-rouge">NavBar</code> component to my project</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- src
  |- components
     |- NavBar
        |- NavBar.js
        |- NavBar.scss     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Say we want to add a CSS called <code class="highlighter-rouge">.navBar</code> to a div in <code class="highlighter-rouge">NavBar.js</code>,
we can define it in <code class="highlighter-rouge">NavBar.scss</code> like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.navBar {
  background-color: #15354e;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I aim to include three things that Iâ€™d seen in other products, but not
combined with a modern interface.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Decode METARs into â€˜plainâ€™ English.
    <ul>
      <li>Help new pilots learn how to read METARs.</li>
      <li>Provide a quick method to look up infrequently used codes.<br />
<img src="/assets/images/2017-06-18/kbfd.png" alt="Decoded METAR" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Display METARs from multiple airports as a list on a single screen.
    <ul>
      <li>This helps with cross-country planning. Being able to quickly
type in weather stations along the route and see them all
displayed <em>simultaneously</em> is a big win for situational awareness.<br />
<img src="/assets/images/2017-06-18/multiple-metars.png" alt="Multiple METARs" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Provide tooltips explaining what the components of the report mean,
and what conditions cause them to be included.<br />

</ol>

<h1 id="future-plans">Future Plans?</h1>

<p>WXDecoder is still very much under active development. The major
upcoming components are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete decoders for all pieces of the METAR. The major components
are complete, but some Remarks still need to be done.</li>
  <li>Provide support for METARs outside the US. Particularly New Zealand,
where Iâ€™ll want to be using it :)</li>
  <li>Add descriptions for all components.</li>
  <li>Add login ability, to allow users to save their sets of home airports,
or ones they use frequently for cross country flights.</li>
  <li>And then the rest of the backlogâ€¦<br />

</ol>

<h1 id="closing-remarks">Closing Remarks</h1>

<p>Iâ€™ve been excited about this project for a while and really happy itâ€™s
now living on the internet. Even in its alpha-stage infancy Iâ€™ve
found it really useful for my preflight briefings.</p>

<p>I welcome feedback, bug reports, criticism, and if youâ€™re interested
in dev updates please follow [@wxdecoder][twitter] on Twitter.</p>
