[Just take me to the photos...](#photos)

The first installment of the 'Weekly 3' resurrection are photos from a flyout to Sacramento Executive with the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) way back in April 2014. Here's an [approximate map of the route][skyvector] on SkyVector.com.

I was incredibly lucky to fly in the back of Oliver's beautiful [Cessna 195][wp_195] from San Carlos to Sacramento, then found myself unexpectedly in a rare [Boeing Stearman][wp_stearman] for the return trip.

I've been a member of the EAA for a short while now and it's something I'd recommend to anyone interested in aviation. Despite the 'Experimental' in the name, the EAA isn't exclusively a range of mad scientists experimenting with crazy aircraft designs (although I won't go as far as to say it precludes it either).

They support a wide range of interests, from homebuilt airplanes, warbirds, to sport aircraft (aerobatics, racing) and a lot more. The people are exceptionally friendly and some of the most knowledgeable pilots and aviation enthusiasts I've met. They also run generous programs, like volunteering to provide free flights to kids between 8 and 17 via [Young Eagles][young_eagles].

For more information on the EAA, you can check out the main website at [eaa.org][eaa_main], or visit the San Carlos chapter's website at [eaa20.org][eaa_ch20].
