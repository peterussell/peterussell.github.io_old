# Basic Requirements
 - at least a 3rd class medical
 - speak, read, write, and understand English

# Knowledge Test
 - 60 multiple choice questions
 - 2 hours 30 minutes
 - score at least 70%
 - must be taken at an FAA-approved test center

# Aeronautical Experience
 - at least 50 hours XC flight time *as PIC* (at least 10 in an airplane, for an airplane IR) 
   - XC definition: one landing more than 50nm in a straight line from the point of departure. [AOPA link][aopa-xc-link] (14 CFR 61.1(b)(3)(ii))
   - touch-and-goes are OK
   - logging PIC time: sole manipulator of the controls of an aircraft for which the pilot is rated or has privileges [AOPA link][aopa-pic-link] (FAR 1.1, 61.51 [e]).
     - Note this is different to *acting* PIC (responsible for the flight)

# Instrument Time
 - at least 40 hours actual or simulated
 - 'Instrument Time': flying solely by reference to the instruments = loggable instrument time
 - at least 15 hours given by a CFII
   - therefore, up to 25 hours with a safety pilot
   - safety pilot must be rated and current the airplane

# Long Instrument XC
 - a minimum of 250nm "along airways or via ATC-directed routing"
 - with at least 1 landing more than 50nm in a straight line from the point of departure
 - requires an instrument approach at each airport on your long XC
 - requires at least 3 types of instrument approaches (GPS, VOR, Localizer, LDA, SDF, NDB, ILS)
 - *not* required to each be at a different airport
