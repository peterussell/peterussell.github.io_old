Number Four: Health (and fitness).

### Climb V7 Indoors

I started climbing at the ripe old age 12 at HangDog in Lower Hutt, and to this day it's still my main form of exercise. Sure, I've been running a bit lately, but I run to help my climbing, not climb to help my running.

At the moment I'm almost exclusively bouldering, mainly because I never got around to taking the belay test. My
ability has a tendency to go in swings and roundabouts, often due to being sore, bored, or just having other
things going on. Enough is enough. The idea is that setting a goal will prevent the
sort of aimless meandering format my climbing currently (or did, back in August) adheres to.

I've climbed V7 before, but I'm currently back down to around V5. I intend to get back to
a level where I can happily call myself a V7 (indoor, San Francisco level) climber.

I also want to climb a lot more outside, but I haven't set any specific metrics for what that constitutes.
I *am* really excited about joining [The Circuit Bouldering Gym][the-circuit] when we move to Portland (oh, I'm moving to Portland in January. More later).

Nailing this V7 stuff isn't rocket science. I just need to work on  getting stronger (campus board, weight training) and lighter, which brings me to...

### Get (back) under 85kg

I hit a weight peak during university (pro tip, not owning scales doesn't help with keeping track
of weight). Pizza and shitty-energy-drink-fuelled all-nighters are a really fun way to get a computer science
degree, but didn't help much with my ability to outrun an attacking bear or execute a perfect pirouette, for
example. Ironically, after moving to the US (land of large, loud people... right? Well, perhaps in some places, but not in San Francisco) I got into the best shape I think I've been in, down around 83kg.

Weight's not something I'm particularly obsessed with. But there's the climbing thing, and the lighter I am the
more I can fit in an airplane. And a 'weight goal' is pretty much a requirement for any list like this. Who am
I to break with years of tradition.

Currently I'm sitting around 88kg. When I started this list in August I was just shy of 92kg (due to late evenings coding and beer), meaning the current trajectory indicates good things.

I've been tracking calories with MyFitnessPal, marvellous, trying to stick with 1,800 calories/day for 6 days a week. The fitness schedule is climbing, running, and biking schedule which has me doing something most days. There's a gym near our new apartment with a swimming pool, which I'm keen to get back into.

Just to throw a spanner in the works, there's an upcoming trip to New Zealand and I haven't had a meat pie in a
long time. We'll have to see how that one plays out.
