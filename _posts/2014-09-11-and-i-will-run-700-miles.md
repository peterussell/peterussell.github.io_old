[Quick link: [running log][spreadsheet]]

With an ominous 28th birthday approaching, an idea presented itself that
I should try to achieve a Big Thing before the 29th, and so began the
journey to run 700 miles (about 1,126 km) in a year.

So why 700 miles?

Well, it's a distance reasonable enough that it doesn't completely
ruin day-to-day life, making me become that ".. sorry I can't, I have to go
for a run" guy. At the same time something far enough that it's not 
trivial to achieve.

Breaking it down the goal is to run at least 58.3 miles per month,
or just over 13 miles per week. That doesn't seem so bad any more. Right?

But the key, for me, is consistency. On occassion I've been known to go for longer
runs of 10+ miles every now and then, but they'd ruin me for a couple of days
and that'd be it for the week. One of the aims of this little adventure is to run shorter
distances more consistently. Ideally I'd like to end up running almost every day
for at least a couple of miles.

I'm using a simple [Google spreadsheet][spreadsheet] to track my progress. Not too
pretty, but it works for now and quick to use. I'm mixing it up betweene outdoor
runs (O) and treadmills (TM) due to some sketchy knees - running every day out
on the asphalt makes for a bad time. I also plan to post regular updates here about
hopes, dreams, feelings, world domination, bowel movem... never mind.
