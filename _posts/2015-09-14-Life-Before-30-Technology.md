I promised to elaborate on each of the tiny expanses of my life that I'd like to do some thing in or about this year. The first, technology, where the underlying goals are either to finish something or learn something. Or both. Sometimes those may be at odds:

I'm impressed by people that stick their heads down and get on with it, and a main focus will be attemping to emulate that while trying to minimise distractions that ultimately a short term wastes of time.

### Project 1: Image Workstation (IWS)

I've worked on the IWS for a number of months now. I've mentioned before that it's a C#.Net desktop app to pull, print and catalog images from a Sony HVO medical imaging device. I'm really excited about getting this finished and installed in a few hospitals.

A good amount of the work for an initial release is done, but a few showstopper bugs are oustanding, and verifying and fixing them has been difficult for various reasons.


### Project 2: Peggy's Adventures

The genesis of Peggy came from the express desire to finishing a project. Silly, right? Although I started it a long time ago I intend to make good on this promise.

Peggy's a text adventure game about a peg-legged red ball with an afro, traveling through times and doing battle some of history's biggest musical names to save his pal from the clutches of evil. Or something. Dun dun dunnn.

The game server is written in C++ (quite a lot of it's actually done, I was surprised when I got it compiling again last week) and will have a web front-end (probably something JavaScripty, see below) for I'm-a-normal-person-with-normal-friends-and-what-the-hell-is-a-terminal-you-damn-nerd types.

And then I can call myself things like a Full Stack Developer. Excellent.

### Project 3: JavaScript Chops

All the new stuff that you can do with JavaScript is really neat, and I want in. I've done some JS development, but not nearly as much as I'd like (and no project from scratch, it's all been bug fixing or featuring development on existing projects). Of particlar interest are Node.js and React.js.

### Project 4: Fortnightly Posts

Well, here you go. I think it'll be a lot of fun to look at the things I've been working on and how things were going at the steps along the way. Also I want to be famous. That's mainly it.

### Project 5: Hardware (surprise!)

I didn't mention this in the original post, but I'd like to try out something in the hardware world. Probably something with a Raspberry Pi. Needs more thought. But it'd be cool!

Thanks for hanging out. Next time, Part 2: Flying!
